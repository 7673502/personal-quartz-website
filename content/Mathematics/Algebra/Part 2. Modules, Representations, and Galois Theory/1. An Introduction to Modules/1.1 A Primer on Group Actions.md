>[!note] Definition: Group Actions
> A group $G$ is said to **act** on a set $X$ if we have a map $(G,X)\to X$ (which we write as $g\cdot x$) that satisfies:
> - $1_g\cdot x = x$ for all $x\in X$
> - $g_1\cdot (g_2\cdot x) = (g_1g_2) \cdot x$ for all $g_1,g_2\in G$ and $x\in X$
## Example Fest
1. $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ acting on $\mathbb{C}$ by $k\cdot z = \exp\left(\frac{2\pi ik}{n}\right)$ (i.e., rotating $z$ by $\frac{2\pi k}{n}$)
2. $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ acting similarly on $\mathbb{R}^2$ by sending $k\cdot v$ to the rotation matrix by $\frac{2\pi k}{n}$.
